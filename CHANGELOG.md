- Changed the way SEE pruning triggers in qsearch. Instead of recomputing SEE
  for each attempt to prune a move, we directly use information from the move
  ordering structure which already tells us if, at this stage, captures lose
  material. It also avoids pruning TT moves when they have a bad SEE.

### Changed (8 changes)

- Simplified the square to bitboard conversion by removing the `SquareBits`
  table.
- Removed the validation loss from the tuning code, since the eval doesn't
  overfit for datasets > 500k positions.
- Fixed core usage in parallel loops during tuning, where one more thread would
  be briefly used due to how workload size was computed.
- Fixed gradient updating, now using a mutex to avoid concurrent writes to the
  gradient array during tuning.
- Fixed dataset generation, now simply filtering non-quiet positions, no
  playouts applied from the engine's search.
- Added FEN printing when a `'d'` command is sent.
- Small naming changes in qsearch.
- Made the Transposition Table reset multithreaded. Enforced memory zeroing to
  avoid page faults slowing down the program on the first search of a game.

  Games | N: 3736 W: 1176 L: 520 D: 2040
  ```

### Fixed (3 changes)

- Fixed issues with benchmark containing commas for CI.
- Fixed some odd behaviors on fixed depth/infinite search with SMP + mate
  pruning on root nodes. (This is technically a functional change, but since
  it only triggers in mate-in-one positions, no regression tests were made.)
- Fixed a dead store of the variable 'piece' in undo_move() function.

### Performance (11 changes)

- Added AdaGrad tuning to the code base and retuned all eval parameters. To use
  Stash in tuning mode, compile with `'CFLAGS="-DTUNE -fopenmp" make ...'`. You
  then can do `./stash-bot dataset_file` to launch the tuning session. The
  expected format for the dataset is `FEN OUTCOME`, with the outcome being 1.0
  for White wins, 0.5 for draws, and 0.0 for Black wins. (Note that it is
  possible to use more fine-grained values like 0.7 and such, but it hasn't
  been tested yet.)

  ```
  The tuner was later changed to include a validation loss and have a better
  output of tuned values.

- Rewrote the King Safety code from scratch, now including the total attack
  count and the potential safe checks on the enemy King. Also changed the KS
  scaling to be quadratic in middlegame, and linear in endgame.

  ```

- Added ponder support to the codebase.

  Games | N: 8612 W: 2055 L: 1877 D: 4680
  ```

- Disabled all pruning code when in check and removed eval computing. The logic
  behind that is that King Safety values get pretty wild for positions with
  check, because if the piece attacking the King is a slider, it may have a lot
  of other possible safe checks along the King line. This test was done in two
  commits, the first one removing computations from search:
  ```
  ELO   | 2.36 +- 1.66 (95%)
  SPRT  | 10.0+0.10s Threads=1 Hash=16MB
  LLR   | 3.01 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
  Games | N: 75936 W: 17338 L: 16822 D: 41776
  ```
  and the second one, done later, removing computations from qsearch:
  ```
  ELO   | 4.25 +- 3.35 (95%)
  SPRT  | 8.0+0.08s Threads=1 Hash=16MB
  LLR   | 2.96 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
  Games | N: 17976 W: 4038 L: 3818 D: 10120
  ```

- Allowed entries with lower depth to conditionally replace other ones in TT.

  positions).

  ```

- Removed the condition that used to disable aspiration windows with high
  scores. (Latest TT patches made Stash much more competitive at finding mates
  without this condition. This is technically  a functional change, but no
  tests were run because the value is above the resign threshold used for test
  games.)

- Added a script for generating opening books in PGN format to the utils/
  folder, and changed the FEN extractor to do a shallow search before adding
  FENs to the dataset.

### Fixed (2 changes)

- Fixed a stack overflow on some systems when the search got too deep. (As
  a result each worker uses a minimum of 8 MB for its stack.)

- Fixed an array overflow in King Safety when the opponent has exactly 8 pieces
  attacking the King.

### Performance (4 changes)

- Changed some eval terms' positions (like the piece pair bonus/malus in the
  corresponding piece eval function) to gain some speed.
  ```
  ELO   | 2.59 +- 1.72 (95%)

  Games | N: 88480 W: 25262 L: 24602 D: 38616
  ```

- Changed the Initiative static value to a dynamic one, based on all pieces
  that are threatened by lower-valued ones. The final score is given like this:
  ```
  stm_iv = !in_check + stm_threats;
  opp_iv = opp_threats;
  bonus = Initiative * (stm_iv * stm_iv - opp_iv * opp_iv);
  ```
  so that having attacks on the opponent's pieces is rewarded even more if we
  are the side to move.

- Created a "real" time managenement system, using the type of bestmove found
  (capture with very large SEE, checking move, only-move, etc.), the eval
  direction (the more it raises, the quicker the move is played), and the
  bestmove stability (stable bestmoves being played quicker). Increased
  max time usage to time / sqrt(movestogo) so that iterations have a high
  chance of being finished before sending the bestmove.

- Added a scaling function for endgames. (Note: this patch has been done via two
  different methods, the first one was using a material key and mapping endgames
  to specialized evals, the second only used the material quantity to evaluate
  the "drawishness" of the eval. The second one looked slightly worse, but
  allowed me to remove about 550+ lines of code with little to no effect. Here's
  the result for the initial version:
  ```
  ELO   | 3.94 +- 3.09 (95%)
  SPRT  | 60.0+0.6s Threads=1 Hash=64MB
  LLR   | 3.03 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
  Games | N: 20192 W: 4330 L: 4101 D: 11761
  ```
  And here's the result for the massive simplification relative to the initial
  version:
  ```
  ELO   | -1.65 +- 4.12 (95%)
  SPRT  | 10.0+0.1s Threads=1 Hash=16MB
  LLR   | -2.95 (-2.94, 2.94) [0.00, 5.00]
  Games | N: 13472 W: 3295 L: 3359 D: 6818
  ```
  So the overall gain is likely about 2-3 Elo.)

- Increased LMR by one ply for non-PV nodes.
